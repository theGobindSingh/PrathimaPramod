export var aboutText = `I’m passionate about helping sensitive therapists avoid burnout because I’m a sensitive therapist who burned out. After just six months as a clinical social worker at Community Mental Health, I couldn’t do it anymore. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was my energetic sensitivity in a traumatic environment that burned me out so quickly. I stayed at CMH for the next three years but had to work part time to gain my licensure.

I was so overwhelmed that first year that I started working with a life coach and eventually became certified as a life coach myself.

I realized that by working in an environment that didn’t align with my strengths, I was sacrificing my health and wellbeing to help others. When I decided to care for my energy first, and found a way to use my skills in alignment with my personality, my life changed completely.`;
